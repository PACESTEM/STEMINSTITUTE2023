# Project

## Steps to work on the project

*  Work as a team
*  Work on NYC data
    * Explore the provided data files
* Brainstorming
    * Come up with a research question (Wednesday)
    * Present your research question (Thursday on arrival)
* Cleaning the data
    * Determine what data you need to answer this question
    * Clean the data (in Python)
* Models / Visualizations / Statistics
    * What types of visualizations / models / statistics do you want to provide? 
    * Think about the high level algorithms to do the data science work
    * Go to Python to do it!
    * Discuss your model and its limitations
    * You may need to iterate! 
* You will use sprints and pair programming DURING class!
* Deliver a presentation
* Deliver a Google Colab notebook
* Presentation in front of an audience (Friday)
* Use of story telling during the presentation
* Mentors will collect presentations and notebooks - all in Google Drive

## Presentation outline

This is recommended but you can modify to some extent. The presentations are 10-minute long (maximum).

The presentation are done in Google Docs (no other software).

- Title (in general the research question)
- Team  (with picture)
- bit.ly to Google Colab Notebook
- Research question
- Description of the data 
- Data science process 
- High-level algorithms / steps
- Python code with comments
- Answer to the research question
- At least two graphs / charts
- Exploration or results graphs / charts
- Discussion on your experience with using real data (science and tech)
